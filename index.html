<div class="angel-fisico2">Mona Megistus is a playable Hydro character in Genshin Impact. An astrologist of great skill and equally-great pride, Mona has taken up residence in Mondstadt to avoid incurring the wrath of her master after unwittingly reading the latter's diary.</div>

<div class="angel-tit">Mona Megistus ✧</div>
<div class="angel-texto1">Mona is an astrologist who takes her passion seriously. She is very knowledgeable in this subject in part and respects, yet also fears her master at the same time. She combines her astrology skills with hydromancy, which makes her a well-known, if still growing astrologist. <b>In part due to her astrology, Mona can tell whether or not a person is lying, can sense their intentions from a single glance, being capable of seeing their fate and is able to accurately deduce a person's traits just from knowing what their constellation is. Being obsessed with astrology gives Mona a sense of pride, but this also serves as a double-edged sword; any Mora she gets her hands on is immediately spent on astrology-related materials, regardless of its cost.</b> She only realizes too late when she has run out of Mora to meet her daily needs, occasionally going without shelter or food for days on end.</div>

Upon my podium as the "know-it-all" scholar
Down in my seat of judgement, gavel's bang, uphold the law
Up on my soapbox, a leader out to change the world
Down in my pulpit as the "holier-than-thou-could-be-messenger" of God Wage the war on organized crime
Sneak attacks, rappel down the rocks behind the lines
Some people risk to employ me, some people live to destroy me
Either way they die, they die
They killed my wife and my baby, with hopes to enslave me
First mistake, last mistake
Paid by the alliance to slay all the giants
Next mistake, no more mistakes Fill the cracks in with judicial granite
Because I don't say it, don't mean I ain't thinking it
Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away
I know what I said, now I must scream of the overdose
And the lack of mercy killings
Mercy killings, mercy killings, killings, Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away</div>
<div class="angel-dream">ENFJs express this cognitive function through their engaging social behavior and harmonious social relationships. They are in tune with other people's feelings, often to the point that they ignore their own needs in order to please others.

People with a protagonist personality place a stronger emphasis on personal, subjective considerations rather than objective criteria when making decisions. How a decision will impact others is often a primary concern.</div>

<div class="angel-content">
<div class="angel-extra">Those who read these pages will feel that there is little hope for humanity, but the remedy has been found, and can be quickly and mercifully applied. A rigid system of selection through the elimination of those who are weak or unfit—in other words, social failures—would solve the whole question in a century, as well as enable us to get rid of the undesirables who crowd our jails, hospitals and insane asylums. The individual himself can be nourished, educated and protected by the community during his lifetime, but the state through sterilization must see to it that his line stops with him or else future generations will be cursed with an ever increasing load of victims of misguided sentimentalism. This is a practical, merciful and inevitable solution of the whole problem and can be applied to an ever widening circle of social discards, beginning always with the criminal, the diseased and the insane and extending gradually to types which may be called weaklings rather than defectives and perhaps ultimately to worthless race types.</div><div class="angel-tit angel-tit3">xoxo</div>
